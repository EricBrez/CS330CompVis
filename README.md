How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project and course in general have taught me the basics for 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional visualization so that I can begin how to learn how to design and build         objects using code, whcih I can devolop both through more coding practice and potentially with a sculptor program.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I began with the lightsaber, I only had the one (technically two if you include the table) objects to practice and organize the skills and code that I have learned and then    when it got closer to the project due date I used the set up that already existed and built into it the code and textures for the other objects, carefully placing each         componant as I got to it, usually trying to start from the ground up.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  One nice aspect of this process is that it allowed me to create a functional template and then build the other objects into it. I think that this is a good approach because    it means that when I am implamenting most of the objects it is adding more repetative code and not structural code. The skeleton is already built, I am just adding the meat    and skin.
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  The process of building a skeleton and then building on it is actually new to me. Previously my approach has been largely linear rather then structural. This methodology       has been fascinating and I think productive and efficient.
How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration has taken into factor through the many versions of the design that I have created to finally get through my project. Each week my process was: Code -> Test -> Turn   in. Then the next wweek I would build on to the existing project.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  At first my project was a mess, I was confused about a lot of the organization and while I could eventually get it to work, it was a mess and difficult to interpret. It        eventually got to the point where i needed to stop, reassess, and reorganize my entire project. Doing this made it much more readable and more importantly much easier to       understand.
